<table>

    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Default Value</th>
    <th>Required</th>

## Calling Mkdir Api
For calling this api, the following details are required to apply:

:::note
The options and parameters introduced in the previous section must be included as json data in the request body part.
:::

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>URL</th>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>ContentType</th>
    <th>Body</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>http://localhost:5860/storage/mkdir</td>
    <td class="centering">POST</td>
    <td class="centering">application/json</td>
    <td>
      ```json
      {
        "path": <STRING VALUE>
      }
      ```
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, if we want to have these details in the form of an http api call, open a new terminal and enter the following command:

:::info
First of all make sure flowsynx is running.
:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="httpApi">
  <TabItem value="bashHttpApi" label="HTTP API (Bash)">
  ```
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "path": "/test/" }' http://localhost:5860/storage/mkdir
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershellHttpApi" label="HTTP API (PowerShell)">
  ```
  Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ "path": "C:/test" }' -Uri 'http://localhost:5860/storage/mkdir'
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Also you can use `Http Api test clients` to test this api. Anyway, after executing this api, a result like below will be obtained.
```
{
  "data": null,
  "messages": [
    "The directory was created successfully."
  ],
  "succeeded": true
}
```

The answer is divided into three `data`, `messages`, and `succeeded` parts. 
`succeeded` indicates the status of the execution of this api which is boolean value and can be true or false. 
`messages` also indicates the list of possible messages that are returned with the response. 
`data` contains the data to be returned.
