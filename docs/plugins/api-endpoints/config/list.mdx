# Config List

Manage configurations related to FlowSynx System. You can setup new remotes and manage existing ones.

## Config list Api options
The options available in this api are described below:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Option name</th>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Default Value</th>
    <th>Required</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>**type**</td>
    <td class="centering">string</td>
    <td></td>
    <td></td>
    <td>
    This option indicates the type of config item in the list of configs. In other words, if this option has a value, the configs will be filtered based on this type and only the configs that are of this type will be returned as a result (if any).
    
    For example the value of this option should be in the following format: 
    `FlowSynx.Storage/Azure.Blob`

    This format indicates the type of plugin to be used.
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Calling Config list Api
For calling this api, the following details are required to apply:

:::note
The options and parameters introduced in the previous section must be included as json data in the request body part.
:::

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>URL</th>
    <th>Method</th>
    <th>ContentType</th>
    <th>Body</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>http://localhost:5860/config</td>
    <td class="centering">POST</td>
    <td class="centering">application/json</td>
    <td>
      ```json
      {
        "type": <STRING VALUE>
      }
      ```
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Now, if we want to have these details in the form of an http api call, open a new terminal and enter the following command:

:::info
First of all make sure flowsynx is running.
:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="httpApi">
  <TabItem value="bashHttpApi" label="HTTP API (Bash)">
  ```
  curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "type": "FlowSynx.Storage/Azure.Files" }' http://localhost:5860/config
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershellHttpApi" label="HTTP API (PowerShell)">
  ```
  Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -ContentType 'application/json' -Body '{ "type": "FlowSynx.Storage/Azure.Files" }' -Uri 'http://localhost:5860/config'
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Also you can use `Http Api test clients` to test this api. Anyway, after executing this api, a result like below will be obtained.
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "18c91659-858b-4fd6-bd20-0125cac86c27",
      "name": "azfile",
      "type": "FlowSynx.Storage/Azure.Files"
    },
    .
    .
    .
  ],
  "messages": [],
  "succeeded": true
}
```

The answer is divided into three `data`, `messages`, and `succeeded` parts. 
`succeeded` indicates the status of the execution of this api which is boolean value and can be true or false. 
`messages` also indicates the list of possible messages that are returned with the response. 
`data` contains the data to be returned. 

:::info
`data` part will have a value only when `succeeded` is true. If `succeeded` is false, this field will be null.
:::

The information including in the result for this api is described as follows:

> **id**: The guid-based identity for configuration item.  
> **name**: The name of configuration item (this name is unique).
