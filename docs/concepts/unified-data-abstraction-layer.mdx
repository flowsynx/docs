# Unified Data Abstraction Layer

The UDAL in FlowSynx provides a seamless interface for accessing, transforming, and synchronizing data across 
heterogeneous sources. It abstracts underlying data complexities, offering a consistent structure for workflow 
integration. By standardizing data models and connection handling, UDAL simplifies data interoperability, 
enhances reusability, and ensures uniform access control and validation across all automated processes. 

Every data source (local file, cloud storage, database, API) is normalized into a consistent internal structure (UDAL). 
This allows the engine to represent and transfer data without being tied to the physical storage location.
