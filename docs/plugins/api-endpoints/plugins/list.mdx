## Plugins list Api options
:::note
This api doesn't have any options.

## Calling Plugins list Api
For calling this api, the following details are required to apply:

:::note
The options and parameters introduced in the previous section must be included as json data in the request body part.
:::

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>URL</th>
    <th>Method</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>http://localhost:5860/plugins</td>
    <td class="centering">GET</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>http://localhost:5860/plugins/{type}</td>
    <td class="centering">GET</td>
  </tr>
</table>

This api can be called in two ways. If it is without any path, it returns the list of all plugins. But if it contains type, then the list of plugins will be filtered based on the entered type.
Currently, the value that can be placed instead of type is only the word `Storage`.

Now, if we want to have these details in the form of an http api call, open a new terminal and enter the following command:

:::info
First of all make sure flowsynx is running.
:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="httpApi">
  <TabItem value="bashHttpApi" label="HTTP API (Bash)">
    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:5860/plugins
    ```
    ```
    curl -X GET http://localhost:5860/plugins/storage
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershellHttpApi" label="HTTP API (PowerShell)">
    ```
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri 'http://localhost:5860/plugins'
    ```
    ```
    Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri 'http://localhost:5860/plugins/storage'
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Also you can use `Http Api test clients` to test this api. Anyway, after executing this api, a result like below will be obtained.
```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "f6304870-0294-453e-9598-a82167ace653",
      "type": "FlowSynx.Storage/LocalFileSystem",
      "description": "Plugin for local file system management. Local paths are considered as normal file system paths, e.g. /path/to/wherever"
    },
    .
    .
    .
  ],
  "messages": [],
  "succeeded": true
}
```

The answer is divided into three `data`, `messages`, and `succeeded` parts. 
`succeeded` indicates the status of the execution of this api which is boolean value and can be true or false. 
`messages` also indicates the list of possible messages that are returned with the response. 
`data` contains the data to be returned. 

:::info
`data` part will have a value only when `succeeded` is true. If `succeeded` is false, this field will be null.
:::

The information including in the result for this api is described as follows:

> **id**: The guid-based identity for plugin item.  
> **type**: The type of plugin item.  
> **description**: The description related to the plugin.
