## Introduction to the FlowSynx

FlowSynx is a flexible, plugin-driven, cross-platform .NET-based DAG workflow orchestration system, 
designed to automate, scale, and manage complex data workflows across cloud and on-premises environments. 
Written in C# and built on .NET, FlowSynx bridges the gap between low-code accessibility and full-code 
extensibility, empowering developers and operations teams to define and execute powerful, declarative 
workflows in a simple, consistent, and maintainable way.

With its modular plugin architecture and native C# SDK, FlowSynx supports seamless integration with 
external systems, custom business logic, cloud storage providers, databases, APIs, and more—allowing 
users to extend functionality without modifying the core engine. Workflows are represented as 
JSON-based [DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs)](/docs/concepts#directed-acyclic-graphs-dags), enabling 
precise control over [execution order, dependencies](/docs/concepts#task-dependencies--execution-order), 
[retries & error handling](/docs/concepts#retry-policies--error-handling), and conditional logic.

### FlowSynx features:
- **Plugin-Based Extensibility** — Add, upgrade, or remove capabilities dynamically and version-controlled  
- **Cross-Platform Execution** — Runs everywhere (Windows, Linux, macOS, Docker, Cloud)  
- **JSON-Defined Workflows** — Declarative, portable, and version-controlled  
- **Schema Validation** — Catch errors early with JSON schema checks  
- **CLI & SDK Support** — Total control for developers and DevOps teams  
- **Robust Authentication & Access Control** — Compatible with JWT and Basic Auth, featuring RBAC  
- **Secret Management Integration** — Infisical, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager  
- **Triggers & Events** — Webhooks, schedules, and file-change detection  
- **Human-in-the-Loop Tasks** — Combine automation with human approval  
- **Conditional Flow Control** — Execute tasks based on conditions and branching logic  
- **Expression Evaluation** — Dynamic parameterization using expressions  
- **Advanced Logging & Auditing** — Full transparency into every execution  
- **Error Handling** - Configurable Error Handling and Retry Policies per task and workflow level  
- **Marketplace & Registry** — Discover and manage plugins easily  
- **Web Console UI** — Intuitive dashboard for workflow monitoring and control  
- **Unified Data Abstraction Layer (UDAL)** — Simplifies data access across diverse sources  
- **Source-Agnostic Processing** — Operate uniformly and interchangeably, regardless of the original data source or protocol  

Whether you’re automating file transfers, orchestrating machine learning pipelines, syncing distributed systems, or building robust ETL jobs, FlowSynx’s C# API and .NET foundation offer a scalable, extensible platform to accelerate workflow development and reduce operational complexity—without sacrificing control.

### Intraction tools
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tools written in .NET for interacting with FlowSynx, enabling workflow management and execution from terminals.
- **REST API Gateway**: Provides secure, HTTP/HTTPS RESTful APIs to integrate with external systems, allowing remote workflow control and status querying.
- **SDK (Library)**: Developer-friendly .NET libraries exposing FlowSynx functionalities programmatically, enabling custom applications to embed or automate workflow operations.
- **UI-Based Console Management**: Browser-based interface for real-time monitoring and administration of workflows and system settings, built with Blazor and .NET backend.

### FlowSynx Core
- **Workflow Orchestrator**: Loads and executes workflows defined as JSON DAGs with native C# execution.
- **Plugin Manager**: Dynamically loads C# plugins as assemblies and maintains a plugin marketplace/registry.
- **Security & Authentication**: Handles authentication and authorization for both REST API and CLI access.
- **Logging & Auditing**: Tracks workflow execution, plugin activity, and audit trails.
- **Trigger Engine**: Listens for external events or schedules workflows to start based on timers, webhooks, or system signals.
- **Error handling**: Built-in support for task retries, timeouts, and fallbacks ensures reliable execution even in unstable environments. Custom retry strategies can be defined per task.

### Execution environments
- **Deployment & Execution Environments**: Supports flexible deployment models from standalone desktop/server installs to cloud containerized orchestration, with full **cross-platform .NET runtime compatibility**.
