# FlowCtl Run Command
The `run` command **starts and executes the FlowSynx system** using the current user’s profile and configuration.  
It can launch FlowSynx interactively in the foreground or as a background service for continuous operation.

## Usage
```bash
flowctl run [options]
```

When executed without any options, FlowSynx runs in the foreground and streams its logs and status to the current terminal session.
