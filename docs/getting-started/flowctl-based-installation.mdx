# Flowctl-based Installation

FlowCtl is the primary command-line interface (CLI) for managing and operating FlowSynx systems. 
This guide will walk you through the installation process across major operating systems, 
including support for versioning, non-administrative installations, and environment setup.

## Prerequisites
Before installation, ensure the following:
- A supported shell environment (`bash`, `powershell`, or equivalent).
- Internet access to download the installation script.
- (Optional) Write access to the target installation directory (e.g., `/usr/local/bin`, `%SystemDrive%\flowsynx`, or a custom path).

## Step 1: Install the FlowCtl
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linux" label="Linux">
    #### Install from Terminal
    Install the latest Linux **flowctl** to `/usr/local/bin`:
    ```
    wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.sh -O - | /bin/bash
    ```

    #### Installing a specific **flowctl** version
    The following example shows how to install **flowctl** version `1.1.1`.
    ```
    wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.sh -O - | /bin/bash -s 1.1.1
    ```

    #### Install without sudo
    If you do not have access to the sudo command or your username is not in the sudoers file, 
    you can install **flowctl** to an alternate directory via the `FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable. 
    This directory must already exist and be accessible by the current user.
    ```
    wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.sh -O - | FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/flowctl" /bin/bash
    ```

    #### Installing a specific **flowctl** version without sudo
    The following example shows how to install **flowctl** version `1.1.1`.
    ```
    wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.sh -O - | FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/flowctl" /bin/bash -s 1.1.1
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
    #### Install from Powershell
    Install the latest windows **flowctl** to $Env:SystemDrive\flowsynx and add this directory to the User PATH environment variable:
    ```
    iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.ps1 | iex
    ```

    #### Installing a specific **flowctl** version
    The following example shows how to install **flowctl** version `1.1.1`.
    ```
    $script=iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.ps1; $block=[ScriptBlock]::Create($script); invoke-command -ScriptBlock $block -ArgumentList "1.1.1"
    ```
  
    #### Install without administrative rights
    If you do not have admin rights, you can install FlowSynx to an alternate directory via the `FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR` environment variable. The script below creates the directory if it does not exist.
    ```
    $Env:FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR = "<your_alt_install_dir_path>"
    $script=iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.ps1; $block=[ScriptBlock]::Create($script); invoke-command -ScriptBlock $block -ArgumentList "", "$Env:FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR"
    ```
  
    #### Installing a specific flowctl version without administrative rights
    The following example shows how to install **flowctl** version `1.1.1`.
    ```
    $Env:FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR = "<your_alt_install_dir_path>"
    $script=iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.ps1; $block=[ScriptBlock]::Create($script); invoke-command -ScriptBlock $block -ArgumentList "0.1.0", "$Env:FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR"
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="macos" label="MacOS">
    #### Install from Terminal
    Install the latest **flowctl** to `/usr/local/bin`:
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.sh | /bin/bash
    ```

    #### Installing a specific **flowctl** version
    The following example shows how to install **flowctl** version `1.1.1`.
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.sh | /bin/bash -s 1.1.1
    ```

    #### Install without sudo
    If you do not have access to the sudo command or your username is not in the sudoers file, you can install 
    **flowctl** to an alternate directory via the FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR environment variable. 
    This directory must already exist and be accessible by the current user.
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.sh | FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/flowctl" /bin/bash
    ```

    #### Installing a specific flowctl version without sudo
    The following example shows how to install **flowctl** version `1.1.1`.
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flowsynx/flowctl/master/install/install.sh | FLOWCTL_INSTALL_DIR="$HOME/flowctl" /bin/bash -s 1.1.1
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info[Register path to the OS Environment Varables]
In linux-based operating system, if you use the **Install without sudo** option, you must register the **$HOME/flowctl** to the PATH of Environment Variables. To do this, you can use below command:

```
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/flowctl
```
:::

## Step 2: Verify the flowctl installation
Verify the CLI is installed by restarting your terminal/command prompt and running the following:
```
flowctl -h
```
#### Output
```
Description:
  flowctl controls the FlowSynx engine

Usage:
  flowctl [command] [options]

Options:
  -?, -h, --help  Show help and usage information

Commands:
  config     Manage and display the list and details of plugin configuration
  health     Display the health status of FlowSynx System
  init       Installs and initializes the FlowSynx system for the current user profile.
  login      Authenticates the user and establishes a session with the FlowSynx system
  logout     Close authentication session with the FlowSynx system
  logs       Get FlowSynx System logs
  plugins    Manage and display the list and details of plugins supported by the FlowSynx system.
  run        Run and execute the FlowSynx system under the current user profile
  stop       Stop the FlowSynx system and its associated applications running under the current user profile.
  uninstall  Uninstalling the FlowSynx System from the current user's profile and local machine environment
  update     Updates the FlowSynx system
  version    Displays the FlowSynx system version and CLI version.
  workflows  Manage and display the list and details of workflows.
```

## Step 3: Initialize FlowSynx
After installing the **flowctl** CLI, the next step is to initialize the FlowSynx runtime environment. 
This process will download and configure the required FlowSynx binaries and prepare your system for 
workflow execution, dashboard hosting, and plugin management.

The **flowctl** init command automates the setup by fetching the latest stable FlowSynx engine and installing 
it locally under your user context or system-wide depending on permissions.

### Open a Terminal or Command Prompt
<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="linuxMacOs" label="Linux/MacOS">
  You will need to use `sudo` for this quickstart if:

  - You run your Docker commands with `sudo`, or
  - The install path is `/usr/local/bin` (default install path).
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="windows" label="Windows">
  Open Windows Terminal or Command Prompt as Administrator to avoid permission issues during installation.

  - Press Start or Windows key.
  - Search for “Command Prompt” or “Windows Terminal”.
  - Right-click the result and choose Run as administrator.
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Run the Initialization Command
Once the terminal is open with the appropriate permissions, run:
```
flowctl init
```

This command performs the following tasks:
- Downloads the latest stable FlowSynx engine.
- Verifies the integrity of downloaded binaries.
- Installs FlowSynx locally for the current user profile.
- Prepares the necessary directories and configuration files.

#### Binary Integrity Check Failure
If the binary fails to validate during download, you may see:
```
Validating download - Fail!  
The downloaded data may has been corrupted!
```

This usually indicates a temporary network or cache issue. To resolve just Re-run the command:
```
flowctl init
```

If the issue persists, clear any proxy cache or DNS override that may interfere with GitHub/CDN access.

## Step 4: Verify FlowSynx Installation
Once initialization completes successfully, verify that the CLI and runtime are properly set up:

```
flowctl version
```

Example Output:
```
{
  "FlowCtl": "1.1.1",
  "FlowSynx": "1.1.2.0"
}
```

Expected Fields:
- FlowCtl: Version of the installed CLI.
- FlowSynx: Version of the runtime system that powers workflow execution.
