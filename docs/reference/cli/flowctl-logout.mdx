# FlowCtl Login Command
The `logout` command **terminates the current authentication session** with a FlowSynx system.  
It clears any cached credentials or session tokens that were previously stored by the `login` command, ensuring that subsequent CLI operations require fresh authentication.

Use this command to explicitly end a session when switching users, decommissioning a workstation, or maintaining strict security policies.

## Usage
```bash
flowctl logout [options]
```

Executes a secure logout procedure and removes any locally stored session artifacts.
