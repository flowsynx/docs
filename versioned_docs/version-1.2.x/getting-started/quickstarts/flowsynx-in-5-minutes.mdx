# FlowSynx in 5 Minutes (Quickstart)
This quickstart guide enables you to install FlowSynx, create a minimal workflow, and run it end-to-end in under five minutes. 
It is designed for first-time users with no prior knowledge of FlowSynx.

## 1. Install FlowSynx

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
  <TabItem value="docker" label="Docker (One-Liner)">
    **The fastest way to run FlowSynx is via Docker.**  
    The following command starts FlowSynx with all required services:

    ```bash
    docker run -d --name flowsynx \
      -p 6262:6262 \
      -v flowsynx_data:/app/data \
      flowsynx/flowsynx:1.2.4-linux-amd64 --start
    ```

    **What this command does:**
    - Pulls the latest FlowSynx image
    - Exposes API on port 6262
    - Persists workflow and execution data in a local Docker volume
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="manual" label="Pre-Built Binary">
    **Prefer to run FlowSynx locally?**  
    Download a pre-built binary for your OS from the latest release:

    [**Releases**](https://github.com/flowsynx/flowsynx/releases/latest)

    After extracting the ZIP file, start FlowSynx with:
    ```
    flowsynx --start
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After the container starts, FlowSynx is available at:

```
http://localhost:6262
```

## 2. Create a Minimal “Hello World” Workflow

Workflows in FlowSynx are defined in JSON.  
The following example writes a text file `results/test.txt` containing the message `"Hello, FlowSynx!"`.

Create a file named:

```
hello-world.json
```

Paste the following content:

```json
{
  "name": "Hello World Workflow",
  "description": "A minimal FlowSynx workflow example",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "Hello world",
      "type": { 
        "plugin": "FlowSynx.Storage.Local",
        "version": "1.0.0"
      },
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "write",
        "path": "/app/data/test.txt",
        "data": "Hello, FlowSynx!",
        "overwrite": false
      },
      "dependencies": [],
    }
  ]
}
```

## 3. Execute the Workflow

You can execute the workflow using either the **FlowCtl CLI** or the **REST API**.

#### Option A — Run with flowctl (recommended)

If you have installed the CLI:

```
flowctl workflows executions execute -f ./hello-world.json
```

Execution begins immediately.  

:::info Flowctl
If flowctl is not installed, please refer to [**Install flowctl**](./getting-started/flowctl-based-installation) guide to help you install it.
:::

#### Option B — Run via REST API

##### 1. Add the workflow:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:6262/workflows \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data @hello-world.json
```

Copy the returned `id` value.

##### 2. Execute the workflow:

```
curl -X POST http://localhost:6262/workflows/<WORKFLOW_ID>/executions
```

## 4. Verify the Output

After successful execution, a file is created at:

```
/app/data/test.txt
```

The file contains:

```
Hello, FlowSynx!
```

This confirms that your FlowSynx environment and workflow engine are working correctly.

## 5. What’s Next?

Now that FlowSynx is installed and your first workflow is running, explore the following:

#### ▶ [**Learn the Workflow Model**](./../../concepts)
Understand DAGs, tasks, dependencies, and error handling.

#### ▶ [**Use the FlowCtl CLI**](./../../reference/cli/overview)
Discover advanced CLI commands for managing workflows, executions, logs, and diagnostics.

#### ▶ [**Integrate with the API**](./../../reference/flowsynx/api)
Use FlowSynx programmatically from your applications and automation systems.
