# Human-in-the-Loop Tasks

Human-in-the-loop tasks are manual intervention points within automated workflows, where human approval, data entry, 
or decision-making is required. These are essential for workflows involving compliance, quality control, exception 
handling, or multi-step business logic where automation alone cannot determine the next action. In FlowSynx, such 
tasks are explicitly modeled in the DAG and pause execution until the assigned user completes their part.
