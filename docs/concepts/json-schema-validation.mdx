# JSON Schema Validation

JSON Schema Validation ensures that every workflow definition, task configuration, and plugin descriptor in FlowSynx 
adheres to a precise, machine-verifiable structure. It acts as both a contract and a guardrail, ensuring that workflows 
are not only syntactically valid but semantically consistent before execution.

In FlowSynx, all workflows are represented as JSON-based Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). To maintain consistency, 
a comprehensive JSON Schema is applied to validate Workflow structure, Task definitions, Dependency integrity, 
Type safety and constraints, Plugin contract validation, etc.
