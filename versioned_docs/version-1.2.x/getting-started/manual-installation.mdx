## Step 1: Download the Release

1. Visit the [FlowSynx GitHub Releases](https://github.com/flowsynx/flowsynx/releases) page.
2. Select the version you wish to install.
3. Download the appropriate archive for your operating system and architecture:

| Platform                                                                  | Architecture | File Format | Filename                       |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|-------------|------------------              |
| <Icon icon="ri:windows-fill" width="24" height="24" /> Windows            | x64          | `.zip`      | `flowsynx-windows-x64.zip`     |
| <Icon icon="ri:windows-fill" width="24" height="24" /> Windows            | arm64        | `.zip`      | `flowsynx-windows-arm64.zip`   |
| <Icon icon="ant-design:linux-outlined" width="24" height="24" /> Linux    | x64          | `.tar.gz`   | `flowsynx-linux-arm64.tar.gz`  |
| <Icon icon="ant-design:linux-outlined" width="24" height="24" /> Linux    | arm64        | `.tar.gz`   | `flowsynx-linux-arm.tar.gz`    |
| <Icon icon="wpf:macos" width="24" height="24" /> macOS                    | x64          | `.tar.gz`   | `flowsynx-osx-x64.tar.gz`      |
| <Icon icon="wpf:macos" width="24" height="24" /> macOS                    | arm64        | `.tar.gz`   | `flowsynx-osx-arm64.tar.gz`    |

## Step 2: Extract the Archive

After downloading the archive, extract it to a preferred location.

### Windows

Use built-in File Explorer or a tool like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/):

```bash
Right-click > Extract All
```

### Linux/macOS
Use the terminal:

```bash
# For .tar.gz archives
tar -xzf flowsynx-<platform>.tar.gz -C /opt/flowsynx
```

You can replace /opt/flowsynx with your desired directory.

## Step 3: Set Executable Permissions (Linux/macOS)
Ensure the binary is executable:

```bash
chmod +x /opt/flowsynx/flowsynx
```

## Step 4: Add to PATH (Optional)
To run flowsynx from anywhere in your terminal, add its directory to your system PATH.

### Windows
1. Press Win + R, type sysdm.cpl, press Enter.
2. Under Advanced tab > Environment Variables.
3. Add the extracted folder path to the Path variable.

### Linux/macOS
Add the following line to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or equivalent:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/flowsynx:$PATH"
```

Then reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

## Step 5: Verify Installation
Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
flowsynx --version
```

You should see the installed version of FlowSynx.

## Step 6: Running the engine
Execute following command into terminal to start flowsynx engine:

```bash
flowsynx --start
```

## Step 7: Running the first command
Once the FlowSynx engine is running (default on port 6262), you can interact with its REST API using tools like curl.

#### Example: Check System Version
This is a good first API call to confirm that the engine is active and healthy:

```bash
curl http://localhost:6262/version
```

#### Expected Output:
```
{
  "data": {
    "version": "1.2.4"
  },
  "messages": [],
  "succeeded": true,
  "generatedAtUtc": "2025-11-15T09:33:28.7058406Z"
}
```
If you receive a response like the above, your FlowSynx engine is up and ready to receive further API commands.
