# FlowCtl Uninstall Command

The `uninstall` command **removes the FlowSynx system** from the current user's profile and the local machine environment.  
It deletes all FlowSynx binaries, configuration data, cached credentials, and supporting files, ensuring a clean decommissioning of the installation.

Use this command when deprovisioning a workstation, reclaiming disk space, or performing a full reinstallation.

## Usage
```bash
flowctl uninstall [options]
```

Executes a complete uninstallation of FlowSynx for the current user.
