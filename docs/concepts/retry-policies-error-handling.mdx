# Retry Policies & Error Handling

Retry policies define how the system should respond to failures during task execution. In a robust workflow engine like 
FlowSynx, each task can have custom retry strategies—such as fixed delays, exponential backoff, or limited retry 
attempts—configured declaratively. This allows workflows to be resilient to transient failures (e.g., temporary network 
issues, slow third-party APIs) without manual intervention.

Error handling complements retries by defining fallback behaviors, like alternative branches, alerts, manual approval 
steps, or graceful workflow termination. FlowSynx supports conditional error paths, enabling workflows to recover or 
adapt when specific failures occur. Together, retry and error handling mechanisms reduce operational burden, increase 
system reliability, and ensure critical workflows complete successfully even in the face of unpredictable runtime conditions.
