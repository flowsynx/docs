# FlowCtl Stop Command
The `stop` command **shuts down the FlowSynx system** and all associated applications that are running under the current user profile.  
It sends a termination signal to gracefully stop active processes, ensuring that any in-flight tasks or workflows are completed or safely canceled.

## Usage
```bash
flowctl stop [options]
```

When executed, this command locates the FlowSynx instance started by the current user and initiates a controlled shutdown.
