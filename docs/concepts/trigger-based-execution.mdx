# Trigger-Based Execution

Event-driven execution allows workflows to start in response to external stimuli, such as a new file upload, a database 
change, an HTTP webhook, or a scheduled time. Triggers decouple workflow initiation from user actions, enabling true 
automation. In FlowSynx, events are often handled through specialized trigger plugins that monitor external systems 
or subscribe to message queues, firing workflows as soon as relevant conditions are met.

This model is ideal for reactive systems, where actions must occur as soon as something changes—like ingesting new data, 
responding to customer activity, or syncing systems in real time. Event-driven execution makes workflows more dynamic 
and efficient, supporting both polling and push-based mechanisms. It enables continuous processing and tight integration 
with systems like IoT, cloud storage, APIs, and databases, forming the backbone of real-time and autonomous operations.
