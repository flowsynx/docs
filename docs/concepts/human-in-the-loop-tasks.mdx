# Human-in-the-Loop Tasks

Automated workflows are powerful, but there are scenarios where **human judgment, approval, or input** is essential. FlowSynx supports this through **human-in-the-loop (HITL) tasks**, which pause workflow execution and require manual intervention before the workflow can continue. This capability combines automation with human oversight, enabling reliable, compliant, and flexible business processes.

Human-in-the-loop tasks are particularly valuable for:

- **Compliance and regulatory workflows**: Ensuring that sensitive operations meet legal or organizational requirements.  
- **Quality control**: Verifying outputs before committing changes or publishing results.  
- **Exception handling**: Allowing human operators to resolve errors or unexpected conditions.  
- **Complex decision-making**: Where automation alone cannot determine the correct next step.  


## How Human-in-the-Loop Works in FlowSynx

In FlowSynx, human-in-the-loop tasks are **explicitly modeled as nodes within a DAG**. When the workflow reaches a HITL node:

1. **Execution pauses** at the task.  
2. The system **notifies the assigned user(s)** via the configured channels (email, web UI, or integrations with collaboration tools).  
3. The user completes the required action—such as approving a request, entering data, or making a decision.  
4. Once the task is completed, **workflow execution resumes**, following the downstream dependencies defined in the DAG.  

This ensures that workflows maintain **deterministic execution order** even when human interaction is required.


## Benefits of Human-in-the-Loop Tasks

### **1. Compliance and Auditability**
HITL tasks leave a clear **audit trail**, recording who performed the action, when, and what decision was made. This is critical for industries such as finance, healthcare, or legal operations.

### **2. Flexible Workflow Design**
Designers can incorporate human judgment only where necessary, while keeping other parts of the workflow fully automated.

### **3. Error Mitigation**
By inserting human checkpoints, organizations reduce the risk of incorrect automated decisions or accidental data corruption.

### **4. Seamless Integration with Automation**
HITL tasks coexist with automated retries, error handling, and data validation mechanisms, ensuring workflows remain resilient and robust even with manual interventions.

### **5. Multi-User Collaboration**
Tasks can be assigned to individual users or groups, supporting parallel reviews, approvals, or joint decision-making.


## Example Use Cases

- **Invoice processing:** Automatically extract invoice data, but require human approval for amounts above a certain threshold.  
- **Content publishing:** Automated content pipelines with human review before publishing articles or marketing material.  
- **Medical imaging workflows:** Automatically process scans but require a radiologist to verify critical findings.  
- **Financial transaction workflows:** Automated fraud detection triggers a human review for flagged transactions.  
- **Customer support automation:** Automatically route tickets but require a human agent to confirm sensitive responses.  


## Implementation Considerations

When designing HITL tasks in FlowSynx:

- Clearly **define the task owner or group** responsible for action.  
- Configure **notifications and reminders** to prevent workflow stalling.  
- Ensure **data visibility and security** so the assigned user has access to relevant information.  
- Set **timeouts or escalation paths** for critical workflows to maintain continuity.  
- Integrate **role-based permissions** to ensure only authorized users can complete specific tasks.  


## Combining HITL with DAGs

Human-in-the-loop tasks seamlessly integrate with FlowSynx’s **DAG-based workflow engine**, maintaining:

- Clear **execution order** with upstream and downstream dependencies.  
- **Retry and error-handling logic** around manual tasks.  
- Consistency in **data propagation** and **state management** across automated and manual steps.  

This makes it possible to build **hybrid workflows** that combine the efficiency of automation with the intelligence of human decision-making.

Human-in-the-loop tasks are a cornerstone for building **robust, compliant, and intelligent workflows** in FlowSynx. By explicitly modeling points of human intervention within a DAG, organizations can balance automation speed with oversight, ensuring workflows remain both efficient and reliable.
