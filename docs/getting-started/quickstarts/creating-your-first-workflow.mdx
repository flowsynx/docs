# Creating Your First Workflow
This guide provides a structured introduction to creating and executing a basic workflow in FlowSynx.  
The example demonstrates how to define workflow components in JSON, initiate an execution using the CLI or API, and review the resulting output.

## Objectives

By the end of this guide, you will understand:

- How to construct a minimal JSON-based workflow definition  
- How tasks and dependencies form a directed acyclic graph (DAG)  
- How to execute workflows using the Dashboard, CLI, or REST API  
- How to verify execution status and inspect generated output 

## 1. Defining a Basic “Hello World” Workflow

FlowSynx workflows are defined using a structured JSON schema. A workflow generally contains:

- **Metadata** — high-level information such as the workflow name and description  
- **Tasks** — individual units of execution, typically backed by plugins  
- **DAG Definition** — declaring dependencies among tasks  
- **Execution Parameters** — plugin settings, retry options, and other controls  

The following example represents a minimal workflow containing a single task that writes a text file to the local file system.

### Example: Minimal Hello World Workflow

```json
{
  "name": "Hello World Workflow",
  "description": "A minimal FlowSynx workflow example",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "Hello world",
      "type": "",
      "parameters": {
        "operation": "write",
        "path": "results/test.txt",
        "data": "Hello, FlowSynx!",
        "overwrite": false
      },
      "dependencies": [],
    }
  ]
}
```

Save the workflow as:

```
hello-world.json
```

## 2. Workflow Structure Overview

This section describes how FlowSynx interprets the key components of the workflow.

#### name

Specifies the display name of the workflow. This value is shown in the Dashboard, logs, and execution listings.

```json
"name": "Hello World Workflow"
```

#### tasks

The tasks array defines all executable units. Each task includes:

- `name`: a unique identifier within the workflow
- `type`: the plugin or built-in handler to execute
- `parameters`: input values required by the specified plugin
- `dependencies`: optional list of task names indicating execution order

In this example:
- `type` is empty (`""`), which instructs FlowSynx to use the built-in Local File System plugin.
- `dependencies` is empty, so the task executes immediately.

## 3. Executing the Workflow

Workflows may be executed through several FlowSynx components:

- The FlowSynx Dashboard
- The API
- The CLI (optional)
- Triggers and automation rules

The following sections demonstrate execution using the CLI and the REST API.

### 3.1 Executing via CLI (flowctl)

Ensure the flowctl command-line tool is installed. For installation instructions, refer to:
[Install Flowctl](/docs/getting-started/flowctl-based-installation)

#### Run from a JSON file

```
flowctl workflows executions execute -f ./hello-world.json
```

### 3.2 Executing via REST API

The REST API provides full programmatic control for managing workflows.
Any standard HTTP client (Postman, HTTPie, curl, etc.) may be used.

For detailed API documentation, refer to:
[Add new Workflow](/docs/reference/flowsynx/api/workflow#add-new-workflow)

#### Step 1: Add the Workflow

##### Endpoint

```
POST http://localhost:6262/workflows/Add
Content-Type: application/json
```

##### Request Body 
Use the same JSON used in the [hello-world-workflow](/docs/getting-started/quickstarts/creating-your-first-workflow#example-hello-world-workflow-minimal)

##### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "586bc7b0-499b-4b01-9510-93ac643ad8bb",
    "name": "Hello World Workflow"
  },
  "messages": [
    "The workflow has been added successfully."
  ],
  "succeeded": true,
  "generatedAtUtc": "2025-11-15T14:40:27Z"
}
```

Record the workflow `id` value — you will need it to execute the workflow.

#### Step 2: Execute the Workflow

##### Endpoint

```
POST http://localhost:6262/workflows/<UUID>/executions
Content-Type: application/json
```

##### Example Response

```json
{
  "data": {
    "workflowId": "586bc7b0-499b-4b01-9510-93ac643ad8bb",
    "executionId": "0878cda6-6df8-44d0-9e4b-1ecbe5c190f1",
    "startedAt": "2025-11-15T14:41:06Z"
  },
  "messages": [
    "Workflow '586bc7b0-499b-4b01-9510-93ac643ad8bb' executed successfully!"
  ],
  "succeeded": true,
  "generatedAtUtc": "2025-11-15T14:41:06Z"
}
```

### 3.3 Viewing Results

After execution completes, navigate to the `results/` directory.
You should find the generated file:

```
results/test.txt
```

The file should contain the following content:

```
Hello, FlowSynx!
```
