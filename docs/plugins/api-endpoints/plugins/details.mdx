## Details Plugin Api options
:::note
This api doesn't have any options.

## Calling Details Plugin Api
For calling this api, the following details are required to apply:

<table class="table">
  <tr>
    <th>URL</th>
    <th>Method</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>http://localhost:5860/plugins/details/{id}</td>
    <td class="centering">GET</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Since this api can be called through GET method, so it's required to fill the **id** with a proper plugin item ID.

Now, if we want to have these details in the form of an http api call, open a new terminal and enter the following command:

:::info
First of all make sure flowsynx is running.
:::

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs groupId="httpApi">
  <TabItem value="bashHttpApi" label="HTTP API (Bash)">
  ```
  curl -X GET http://localhost:5860/plugins/details/f6304870-0294-453e-9598-a82167ace653
  ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="powershellHttpApi" label="HTTP API (PowerShell)">
  ```
  Invoke-RestMethod -Method Get -Uri 'http://localhost:5860/plugins/details/f6304870-0294-453e-9598-a82167ace653'
  ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Also you can use `Http Api test clients` to test this api. Anyway, after executing this api, a result like below will be obtained.
```
{
  "data": {
    "id": "f6304870-0294-453e-9598-a82167ace653",
    "type": "FlowSynx.Storage/LocalFileSystem",
    "description": "Plugin for local file system management. Local paths are considered as normal file system paths, e.g. /path/to/wherever"
  },
  "messages": [],
  "succeeded": true
}
```

The answer is divided into three `data`, `messages`, and `succeeded` parts. 
`succeeded` indicates the status of the execution of this api which is boolean value and can be true or false. 
`messages` also indicates the list of possible messages that are returned with the response. 
`data` contains the data to be returned. 

:::info
`data` part will have a value only when `succeeded` is true. If `succeeded` is false, this field will be null.

> **id**: The guid-based identity for plugin item.
