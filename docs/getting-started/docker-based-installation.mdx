description: FlowSynx is fully container-ready, making it easy to deploy in isolated, reproducible environments using Docker. This option is highly recommended for users looking to minimize conflicts, simplify upgrades, and ensure consistent behavior across development, staging, and production environments. Docker Compose configurations are also available for multi-container setups.

# Docker-based Installation

You can run FlowSynx entirely within Docker without requiring any local installation of FlowSynx binaries or the FlowCtl CLI. 
This is ideal for isolated environments, CI/CD pipelines, or container-native deployments.

Prerequisites
Ensure the following components are installed and configured:

## Prerequisites
- Install Docker Engine (v20.10 or later)
- Internet access to pull FlowSynx container images

**Recommended:**
- Docker Compose v2+ (optional but simplifies multi-container orchestration)
- Minimum 1 GB RAM and 500 MB disk space

## Step 1: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a new file named `docker-compose.yml` in your working directory:
```
version: '3.8'

services:
  flowsynx:
    image: flowsynx/flowsynx:1.1.2-linux-amd64
    container_name: flowsynx
    environment:
      DB__HOST: postgres
      DB__PORT: 5432
      DB__NAME: flowxDb
      DB__USERNAME: postgres
      DB__PASSWORD: postgrespw
      Security__EnableBasic: true
      Security__BasicUsers__0__Id: 0960a93d-e42b-4987-bc07-7bda806a21c7
      Security__BasicUsers__0__Name: admin
      Security__BasicUsers__0__Password: admin
      Security__BasicUsers__0__Roles__0: admin
      Security__DefaultScheme: Basic
    volumes:
      - flowsynx-data:/app
    working_dir: /app
    ports:
      - "6262:6262"
    command: ["--start"]
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    networks:
      - basicAuth_net

  postgres:
    image: postgres:15
    container_name: flowsynx-db
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: postgrespw
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    restart: unless-stopped
    networks:
      - basicAuth_net

volumes:
  flowsynx-data:
  pgdata:
  
networks:
  basicAuth_net:
    driver: bridge
```

## Step 2: Launch FlowSynx with Docker Compose
Run the following command in the same directory as the `docker-compose.yml` file:
```
docker compose up -d
```

This will:
- Pull the FlowSynx engine image (if not already available locally)
- Start containers in detached mode
- Mount a persistent volume for configuration and data

## Step 3: Verify the Deployment
#### Check if containers are running successfully:
```
docker compose ps
```

Expected output:
```
NAME                 COMMAND               STATUS              PORTS
flowsynx             "/app/FlowSynx"       Up 30 seconds       0.0.0.0:6262->6262/tcp
```

#### Check container logs if needed:
```
docker logs flowsynx
```

#### Cleanup
To stop and remove all services and containers:
```
docker compose down
```

To remove persistent data as well:
```
docker compose down -v
```
